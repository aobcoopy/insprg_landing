<br><br>
No manuscript is accepted for IJMBE until it has been reviewed by the Editor or one of the Associate Editors and at least two outside reviewers who are experts in their respective fields.
<br><br>
All manuscripts are judged on their contribution to the advancement of the science and/or practice of business management. The editors expect all manuscripts to follow accepted standards for scholarly work. Manuscripts are judged not only on depth and scope of ideas presented and their contribution to the field, but also on their clarity, organization, readability, and comprehensibility.
