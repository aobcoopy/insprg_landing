<h2>Presentation and Formatting</h2>
Manuscripts should be typed single-spaced in 12-point type using Times Roman or similar type. Use single spacing in endnote references. Please allow the text to wrap, rather than entering a RETURN or LINEFEED after every line.<br><br>

Manuscripts should be submitted electronically, preferably in Microsoft Word, to the Editors at the following e-mail address: ungul.la@spu.ac.th.  It is not possible to submit an electronic copy, send four (4) copies of the manuscript to the Editors. Non-electronic submissions require more time to administer, so authors should be aware that the processing time for their manuscripts will be longer. 
<br><br>
The sections of the manuscript should be placed in the following order: Cover page, Title page, Authors, Abstract (on a page by itself) and Body, Illustrations, Citation, References, and Appendices.
<br><br>
<strong>Cover Page</strong>
<br><br>
The cover page should include the title of the manuscript and the authors’ name(s) in the order in which they will be printed. The following information should be provided for each co-author: name, title, university/company name, mailing address, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address. Please indicate which co-author will serve as the primary contact for the Journal.
<br><br>
In addition to any acknowledgment of financial or technical assistance, this page should include each author’s title, present position, and complete address and telephone number. Please keep professional titles succinct.
<br><br>
<strong>Title Page</strong>
<br><br>
Type the title in bold type, all caps, single-spaced, and centered across the top of the first page, in 14 point Times New Roman, as illustrated above. 
<br><br>
<strong>Authors</strong>
<br><br>
The author(s), affiliation(s), mailing address(es), and e-mail address(es) should be single-spaced and centered on the line below the title, in 12 point bold Times New Roman for the author(s), and in normal Times New Roman for the remainders. One line space should be used to separate author(s) from the paper title. Please do not use titles such as Dr., Professor, etc.
<br><br>
<strong>Abstract (on a page by itself), and Body</strong>
<br><br>
Introduce the paper with an abstract of approximately 100-200 words, in 12 point Times New Roman. Begin with the centered heading “Abstract”. All body paragraphs should begin flush left (no paragraph indent) and right justified. Single-space the body of the paper. Use 12 point Times New Roman throughout. Figures and tables should be placed as close as possible to where they are cited. First-level headings state the table or figure number. All tables and images should be embedded into the file and sized appropriately. All photographs should be sampled at 300 dpi (dots per inch). Keep in mind that web graphics are typically sampled at 72 dpi. Photographs must be properly sized and positioned in the body of the paper.
