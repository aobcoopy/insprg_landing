<h2>Tables and Figures</h2>
Each illustration should be numbered consecutively within its series type (Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1, Figure 2).  If illustrations appear in appendices, they should be numbered consecutively, but separately from body illustrations (e.g., Table A-1, Figure A-1). In the text, refer to tables and figures by their numbers.  Avoid using “above,” “below,” “preceding,” and similar terms. All Tables and Figures must have titles. Titles for each Table and Figure should be descriptive but not lengthy. The title should be in bold letters at the top of the Table or Figure.
<br><br>
Tables and Figures should be called “Table” or “Figure” and should be followed by a blank line and then the title for the table or figure also in bold letters at the top of the table or figure.
<br><br>
For Journal purposes, tables and figures are defined as follows: a table is comprised of rows and columns of numbers and/or text; a figure is a chart, graph, diagram, map, drawing, or any other non-text item that is not a table. Tables should be typed in the following style:
<br><br>
<strong>General Design</strong>
<br><br>
For more effective communication and better quality reproduction when printed, tables and figures should be kept as simple and uncluttered as possible, while conveying all necessary information.
<br><br>
<strong>Details</strong>
<br><br>
Footnotes should appear directly below illustrations, flush with the left edge, and they should be designated by small letters, rather than asterisks or numerals. Column or row heads should be footnoted only if the footnote applies to all items in the column or row. Complete source information must be provided for illustrations copied or derived from other sources. This complete information should be provided and an author-date citation should be given in a source note on the illustration. (Source notes are sized and placed like footnotes, below any footnotes for the illustration.)
<br><br>
If elements on an illustration are not labelled, but represent certain categories, items, or amounts, a complete key (legend) should be included. Make sure that necessary measures of statistical significance are reported with each illustration. Designate units (percent, dollars, hours, etc.) in column and row headings (tables) or in element labels or keys (figures). Separate from each figure, give numerical values for all points, bars, pie slices, etc., so that they can be readily reproduced by the typesetter, if necessary. Double-check formulae and mathematical terms and equations for consistency, readability, and accuracy. Add extra space between characters to clarify and separate the terms, and be sure that sub and superscript relationships are clear. Check for opening and closing parenthesis and brackets. Write the names of Greek and special characters in the margin.
Use tab indents or column alignment, rather than spaces, to align columns and indent headings.
<br><br>
English (USA) spelling should be used; foreign terms not commonly used in English (USA) should be italicized.
<br><br>
<strong>Regarding Mathematical Notation</strong>
<br><br>
The percent sign (%) should be used in text and in tables. Mathematical notation must be clear within the text and illustrations. All equations must be very clearly typed. Display (separate line) equations should be aligned to the left margin. Italic type is used for letters in equations, except for trigonometric functions and logarithm abbreviations, which are plain (normal) type. Matrices and vectors are in boldface type. (If these cannot be typed in italic and boldface, italic type can be indicated by a hand-drawn straight underline and boldface by a wavy underline). Unusual and Greek symbols should be typed in the text using the Symbol capability. If no Symbol capability is possible, such special characters should be identified by name in a marginal note. (This is important; the editor may be not familiar with these symbols and may have difficulty producing the correct one without a marginal note.) For equations that might be too long to type in a 6” column, indicate appropriate breaks.

<strong>Citation</strong>
<br><br>
The IJMBE follows the reference format of Academy of Management Journal. This format is available at the AMJ's websitehttp://aom.pace.edu/amjnew/style_guide.html. The use of footnotes is discouraged.

<strong>References</strong>
<br><br>
References are to be listed alphabetically, last name first, followed by publication date in parentheses. Use full first name, not just initials. The reference list should be typed single-spaced in 12-point type. Please let the Endnotes wrap rather than using tabs or returns at the end of internal lines. Do not use indents, tabs, or symbols to delineate your paragraphs. Instead, use two hard returns between each reference.

Authors are responsible for the accuracy of their references. Check them carefully. Readers’ questions and comments about incomplete and inaccurate References will be referred to the article authors with a follow-up by the Editor. All authors of a referenced work should be listed; et al. should not be used in the Reference list. Undefined acronyms should not be used.

<strong>Appendices</strong>

If any mathematical proof or development is used but not critical to the exposition of the main argument of the manuscript, authors should include it in an appendix.  An appendix may also be used for the mathematical material that may be beyond the level of the average reader.
