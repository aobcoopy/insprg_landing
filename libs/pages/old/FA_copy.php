<h2>Copyright and Permissions</h2>

Submitting a manuscript to IJMBE constitutes an assignment of copyright to the Journal and a guarantee that the work is original.  It also indicates that the author(s) owns it, and that no part of it has been previously published in substantially the same form, that it is not being published or considered for publication elsewhere, and that any use of othersâ€™ materials is by permission or falls within fair use standards of copyright law. The author(s) is responsible for obtaining any necessary permission from copyright holders and for paying any necessary fees.  Extensive paraphrasing is considered disguised copying; permission is required.
